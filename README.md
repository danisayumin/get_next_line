The **get_next_line** project is a fundamental project that aims to develop a function capable of reading a line from a file descriptor. It allows you to retrieve the next line from a file, one line at a time, without reading the entire file at once. The function is designed to be memory efficient and work seamlessly with multiple file descriptors.
